# BaseMvRxViewModels loads the Companion class via reflection and thus we need to make sure we keep
# the name of the Companion object.
#-keepclassmembers class ** extends com.airbnb.mvrx.BaseMvRxViewModel {
#    ** Companion;
#}

# Classes extending BaseMvRxViewModel are recreated using reflection, which assumes that a one argument
# constructor accepting a data class holding the state exists. Need to make sure to keep the constructor
# around. Additionally, a static create method will be generated in the case a companion object factory
# is used. This is accessed via reflection.
#-keepclassmembers class ** extends com.airbnb.mvrx.BaseMvRxViewModel {
#    public <init>(...);
#    public static *** create(...);
#}

# Members of the Kotlin data classes used as the state in MvRx are read via Kotlin reflection which cause trouble
# with Proguard if they are not kept.
#-keepclassmembers class ** implements com.airbnb.mvrx.MvRxState {
