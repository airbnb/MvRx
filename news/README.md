# News Sample app

This application is meant to show how to use [Dagger](https://github.com/google/dagger) and [AssistedInject](https://github.com/square/AssistedInject)
with MvRx.

To build and run this sample, you need to get a free API Key for [NewsAPI.org](https://newsapi.org/).

Once you have acquired the API key, place it in your system's `gradle.properties` file as:

> ~/.gradle/gradle.properties
```
NEWS_API_KEY = "<your api key>"
```
